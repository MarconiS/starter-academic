The NeonTreeCrowns dataset is a set of individual level crown estimates for 100 million trees at 37 geographic sites across the United States surveyed by the National Ecological Observation Networkâ€™s Airborne Observation Platform. Each rectangular bounding box crown prediction includes height, crown area, and spatial location.
