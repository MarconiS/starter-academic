Results of the study titled "Disentangling the role of phylogeny and climate on joint leaf trait distributions across Eastern United States". The archive contains three csv files with estimates of N%, C%, LMA, Carotenoids%, ChlorophyllA, ChloropyllB, Lignin and Cellulose for ~1.2 million individual trees sampled by the Forest Inventory and Analysis from 2015 to 2019. Each estimate was produced sampling the posterior distribution of the three models saved as .rds files, and contain the associated uncertainty (estimate error and 95 prediction intervals).
